                        Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan OM ( pronunciation (help·info); 5 September 1888 – 17 April 1975), natively Radhakrishnayya, was an Indian philosopher and statesman. He served as the second president of India from 1962 to 1967. He was also the first vice president of India from 1952 to 1962.

                        After he took charge as the President of India in 1962, some students sought permission from him to celebrate his birthday. Dr Radhakrishnan, however, did not approve any fancy celebration but rather requested that the day be observed as Teachers' Day.
